                <h2> Successfully integrating Gray Wolves in Sierra Mountains </h2>
                <p> Historical evidence shows that this was also the last known home to wolves in California, after they
                    were previously inhabiting San Diego coastal region. Their move from coastal regions in San Diego
                    was
                    due to humans colonizing and exploring and with their only predator being present they began to
                    either
                    be killed or disperse for safety. The San Diego region being so industrialized there is no space, so
                    the
                    Sierra Mountains is the second-best option in trying to
                    maintain some type of adherence to historical habitats and best suitable environment.
                    <br>
                    This can be achieved by coordinating with <span class="boldtext italictext">Yosemite National
                        Park </span>wolf authorities and experts in
                    ensuring a smooth transition of wolves, identifying best area for the wolves to flourish, and
                    gaining
                    funding from <span class="italictext">The California Fish and Wildlife Services</span> to provide
                    sufficient capital to make this a
                    reality
                </p>
                <h2> The integration of nonlethal deterrent methods for wolves currently in California </h2>
                <p> There needs to be <span class="boldtext">nonlethal deterrents</span> put in place and used by
                    farmers in
                    California currently whilst
                    the move is still in the preparation stage. There are small number of wolves currently in that
                    region
                    and there have already been killings of wolves in California and they haven’t been present long, one
                    being attributed to a rancher in Northern California after it was spotted feeding on one of the
                    livestock.

                <h2> The integration, sole-use of, or further explored use of noninvasive Wolf Howl monitoring
                    technology
                </h2>
                <p> The goal is to implement the use of <span class="boldtext">non-invasive</span> wolf howl monitoring
                    technology as an effective
                    replacement for the usual ‘collar-method’ whereby wolves get captured, sedated, and fitted with
                    collar
                    tracking technology. The technology behind acoustic monitoring will be further elaborated on later
                    in
                    the plan along with supporting evidence.
                    <br>
                    The implementation of microphones in the areas prior to wolf reintegration in the selected area
                    gives us
                    time to prepare for these wolves. This not only provides us the opportunity to utilize a noninvasive
                    alternative to the collar method. Additionally, the wolves that are moved to that region will be
                    inevitably captured to make this move possible, during capture sedation is inevitable, meaning we
                    can
                    use this inevitable period to place collars on the new wolves in that region. We will then be able
                    to
                    utilize the new technology in collaboration with the collar-method to prevent future need for
                    capturing
                    as the acoustic monitoring technologies will already be in place.
